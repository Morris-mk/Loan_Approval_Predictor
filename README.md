## Introduction
For any financial service provider worldwide, determining loan approvals and disbursements is a critical process. This project aims to objectify this process by developing a predictive model based on fundamental customer data, leading to unbiased decisions.

## Objective
Our primary goal is to build robust machine learning models that can accurately and objectively predict loan approval status and the corresponding loan disbursement amount.


# Methodology
We'll analyze a comprehensive dataset containing over 58,000 financial records. This dataset includes crucial factors such as person_age, person_income, person_home_ownership, person_emp_length, loan_intent, loan_grade, and other relevant features, all of which are used by lending institutions to assess loan eligibility.

To achieve our objectives, we'll leverage Python's powerful libraries:

- Pandas and NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

- Seaborn and Matplotlib: To visualize the data, uncover trends, and gain valuable insights.

Subsequently, we will utilize Scikit-learn to build our machine learning models. We plan to experiment with both **parametric** and **non-parametric** models to identify the most effective one for predicting loan approval status and disbursement amounts.
